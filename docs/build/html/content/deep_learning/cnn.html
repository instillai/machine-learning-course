<p>In the last module, we started our dive into deep learning by talking about
multi-layer perceptrons. In this module, we will learn about <strong>convolutional
neural networks</strong> also called <strong>CNNs</strong> or <strong>ConvNets</strong>. CNNs differ from other
neural networks in that sequential layers are not necessarily fully connected.
This means that a subset of the input neurons may only feed into a single
neuron in the next layer. Another interesting feature of CNNs is their inputs.
With other neural networks we might use vectors as inputs, but with CNNs we
are typically working with images and other objects with many dimensions.
<em>Figure 1</em> shows some sample images that are each 6 pixels by 6 pixels. The
first image is colored and has three channels for red, green, and blue values.
The second image is black-and-white and only has one channel for gray values</p>
<div class="figure" id="id1">

<p>CNNs are widely used in computer vision where we are trying to analyze visual
imagery. CNNs can also be used for other applications such as natural language
processing. We will be focusing on the former case here because it is one of
the most common applications of CNNs.</p>
<p>Because we assume that we’re working with images, we can design our
architecture so that it specifically does a good job at analyzing images.
Images have heights, depths, and one or more channels for color. In an image,
there might be lines and edges that make up shapes as well as more complex
structures such as cars and faces. We will potentially need to identify a
large set of relevant features in order to properly classify an image. But
just identifying individual features in an image usually isn’t enough. Say we
have an image that may or may not be a face. If we saw three noses, an eye,
and an ear, we probably wouldn’t call it a face even though those are common
features of a face. So then we must also care about where features are located
in the image and their proximity to other features. This is a lot of
information to keep track of! Fortunately, the architecture of CNNs will cover
a lot of these requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Architecture</a><a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The architecture of a CNN can be broken down into an input layer, a set of
hidden layers, and an output layer. These are shown in <em>Figure 2</em>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="../../_images/Layers.png" src="../../_images/Layers.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 2. The layers of a CNN</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>The hidden layers are where the magic happens. The hidden layers will break
down our input image in order to identify features present in the image. The
initial layers focus on low-level features such as edges while the later
layers progressively get more abstract. At the end of all the layers, we have
a fully connected layer with neurons for each of our classification values.
What we end up with is a probability for each of the classification values. We
choose the classification with the highest probability as our guess for what
the image show.</p>
<p>Below, we will talk about some types of layers we might use in our hidden
layers. Remember that sequential layers are not necessarily fully connected
with the exception of the final output layer.</p>
<div class="section" id="convolutional-layers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Convolutional Layers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#convolutional-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first type of layer we will discuss is called a <strong>convolutional layer</strong>.
The convolutional description comes from the concept of a convolution in
mathematics. Roughly, a convolution is some operation that acts on two input
functions and produces an output function that combines the information
present in the inputs. The first input will be our image and the second input
will be some sort of filter such as a blur or sharpen. When we combine our
image with the filter, we extract some information about the image. This
process is shown in <em>Figure 3</em>. This is precisely how the CNN will go about
extracting features.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id3">
<img alt="../../_images/Filtering.png" src="../../_images/Filtering.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 3. An image before and after filtering</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>In the human eye, a single neuron is only responsible for a small region of
our field of view. It is through many neurons with overlapping regions that we
are able to see the world. CNNs are similar. The neurons in a convolutional
layer are only responsible for analyzing a small region of the input image but
overlap so that we ultimately analyze the whole image. Let’s examine that
filter concept we mentioned above.</p>
<p>The <strong>filter</strong> or <strong>kernel</strong> is one of the functions used in the convolution.
The filter will likely have a smaller height and width than the input image
and can be thought of as a window sliding over the image. <em>Figure 4</em> shows a
sample filter and the region of the image it will interact with in the first
step of convolution.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id4">
<img alt="../../_images/Filter1.png" src="../../_images/Filter1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 4. A sample filter and sample window of an image</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>As the filter moves across the image, we are calculating values for the
convolution output called a <strong>feature map</strong>. At each step, we multiply each
entry in the image sample and filter elementwise and sum up all the products.
This becomes an entry in the feature map. This process is shown in <em>Figure 5</em>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id5">
<img alt="../../_images/Filter2.png" src="../../_images/Filter2.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 5. Calculating an entry in the feature map</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>After the window traverses the entire image, we have the complete feature map.
This is shown in <em>Figure 6</em>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id6">
<img alt="../../_images/Filter3.png" src="../../_images/Filter3.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 6. The complete feature map</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>In the example above, we moved the filter one unit horizontally or one unit
vertically from some previous position. This value is called the <strong>stride</strong>. We
could have used other values for the stride but using one everywhere tends to
produce the best results.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the feature map we ended up with had a smaller
height and width than the original image sample. This is a result of the way
we moved the filter around the sample. If we wanted the feature map to have
the same height and width, we could <strong>pad</strong> the sample. This involves adding
zero entries around the sample so that moving the filter keeps the dimensions
of the original sample in the feature map. <em>Figure 7</em> illustrates this process.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id7">
<img alt="../../_images/Padding.png" src="../../_images/Padding.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 7. Padding before applying a filter</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>A feature map represents one type of feature we’re analyzing the image for.
Often, we want to analyze the image for a bunch of features so we end up with
a bunch of feature maps! The output of the convolution layer is a set of
feature maps. <em>Figure 8</em> shows the process of going from an image to the
resulting feature maps.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id8">
<img alt="../../_images/Convo_Output.png" src="../../_images/Convo_Output.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 8. The output of a convolutional layer</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>After a convolutional layer, it is common to have a <strong>ReLU</strong> (rectified linear
unit) layer. The purpose of this layer is to introduce non-linearity into the
system. Basically, real-world problems are rarely nice and linear so we want
our CNN to account for this when it trains. A good explanation of this layer
requires math that we don’t expect you to know. If you are curious about the
topic, you can find an explanation <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/rectified-linear-units-relu-in-deep-learning">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pooling-layers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Pooling Layers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#pooling-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next type of layer we will cover is called a <strong>pooling layer</strong>. The
purpose of pooling layers are to reduce the spatial size of the problem. This
in turn reduces the number of parameters needed for processing and the total
amount of computation in the CNN. There are several options for pooling but we
will cover the most common approach, <strong>max pooling</strong>.</p>
<p>In max pooling, we slide a window over the input and take the max value in the
window at each step. This process is shown in <em>Figure 9</em>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id9">
<img alt="../../_images/Pooled.png" src="../../_images/Pooled.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 9. Max pooling on a feature map</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>Max pooling is good because it maintains important features about the input,
reduces noise by ignoring small values, and reduces the spatial size of the
problem. We can use these after convolutional layers to keep the computation
of problems manageable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fully-connected-layers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Fully Connected Layers</a><a class="headerlink" href="#fully-connected-layers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The last type of layer we will discuss is called a <strong>fully connected layer</strong>.
Fully connected layers are used to make the final classification in the CNN.
They work exactly like they do in other neural networks. Before moving to the
first fully connected layer, we must flatten our input values into a
one-dimensional vector that the layer can interpret. <em>Figure 10</em> shows a
simple example of converting a multi-dimensional input into a one-dimensional
vector.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id10">
<img alt="../../_images/Flatten.png" src="../../_images/Flatten.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 10. Flattening input values</strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>After doing this, we may have several fully connected layers before the final
output layer. The output layer uses some function, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/multi-class-neural-networks/softmax">softmax</a>,
to convert the neuron values into a probability distribution over our classes.
This means that the image has a certain probability for being classified as
one of our classes and the sum of all those probabilities equals one. This is
clearly visible in <em>Figure 11</em>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id11">
<img alt="../../_images/Layers_Final.png" src="../../_images/Layers_Final.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><strong>Figure 11. The final probabilistic outputs</strong></span></p>

<div class="section" id="training">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Training</a><a class="headerlink" href="#training" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have the architecture in place for CNNs we can move on to
training. Training a CNN is pretty much exactly the same as training a normal
neural network. There is some added complexity due to the convolutional layers
but the strategies for training remain the same. Techniques, such as gradient
descent or backpropagation, can be used to train filter values and other
parameters in the network. As with all the other training we have covered,
having a large training set will improve the performance of the CNN. The
problem with training CNNs and other deep learning models is that they are
much more complex than the models we covered in earlier modules. This results
in training being much more computationally expensive to the point where we
would need specialized hardware like GPUs to run our code. However, we get
what we pay for because deep learning models are much more powerful than the
models covered in earlier modules.</p>

<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Summary</a><a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this module, we learned about convolutional neural networks. CNNs differ
from other neural networks because they usually take images as input and can
have hidden layers that are not fully connected. CNNs are powerful tools
widely used in image classification applications. By using a variety of hidden
layers, we can extract features from an image and use them to
probabilistically guess a classification. CNNs are also complex models and
understanding how they work can be an intimidating task. We hope that the
information presented gives you a better understanding of how CNNs work so
that you can continue to learn about them and deep learning.</p>
